   <h1>STORY</h1>
   <p>
      the story of feisty young Divya, who is secretly mourning the death of her lover, but reluctantly agrees to an arranged marriage with Chandrakumar. What follows is a poetic, whimsical and sometimes dramatic exploration of the meaning of agency, love, conformity and marriage. 
   </p>
  <p>
   The film begins with a rebellious Divya (Revathi) prancing around the house, turning her nose up at the seemingly scandalous romance that her brother and sister-in-law are having, demanding hot coffee and hiding from her strict father. When her father does not chastise her for waking up late and instead smiles and tells her to carry on with her work, she’s puzzled. She later understands that a family is going to come ‘see’ her for marriage later that evening. Divya absolutely detests this idea and stays behind in college until late at night to avoid meeting the prospective groom. When she returns home, she’s shocked to find the family still waiting for her! She speaks rudely with Chandrakumar, the prospective groom, in the hope that he will reject her. Instead, he says yes to the marriage because he falls for her rebellious spirit and frank attitude.

   On their first night, Divya refuses to have anything physical to do with Chandrakumar and instead tells him that she wants to go to sleep. This is not a big deal for his character, but is in stark contrast to the depiction of the first night in the original short story, where her husband has her way with her. Divya isn’t a woman who minces her words, she says what she wants to frankly. In one of their heated discussions, she asks Chandrakumar for a divorce when he asks her what gift she would like as a marriage present. Shocked by this, Chandrakumar listens to her when she tearfully breaks down and narrates the story of her past lover, Manohar, who died after being shot accidentally by a police officer. She confesses that ‘her heart is not with her’, and that’s why she can’t stay in their marriage. 


After being told that they can only qualify for divorce once they have stayed together for a year - and not seven days into the marriage - the young couple begin to live as friends. But slowly Divya begins to develop real feelings for Chandrakumar, not because of the forced circumstances demanding they coexist with one other but rather because her heart opens up to the possibility of a fresh start to love as she peacefully buries the memory of Manohar.
