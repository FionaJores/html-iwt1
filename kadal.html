  <h1>STORY</h1>
  <p>
   Kadal narrates the story of a boy, Thomas, who is orphaned but is praised by God Jesus. 
   Father Sam mentions twice that "he is the son of Jesus." Later, after some conflicts, 
   his thoughts go astray, leading him to commit mistakes. As he commits mistakes, 
   blessings from Jesus decrease gradually. This causes him to lose Father Sam (to jail) 
   and his father (who dies in his hands).
  </p>
 <p>
   In the second half, he realizes the mistakes he has committed through Peatrics 
   (the heroine). She tells him that "he is forgiven," and since she is a child, her 
   voice is considered to be Jesus's praise. Thus, he regains the blessings of Jesus 
   in the name of Peatrics.
 </p>
 <br>
 <b>The story ends with Jesus Christ's message:</b>
 <b>"I will be with you since you realized your mistakes."</b><br>
