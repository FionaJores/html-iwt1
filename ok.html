   <h1>STORY</h1>
   <p>
      To the discerning, it would feel that OK Kanmani romanticises live-in relationships, but that is not the true case. One of the best scenes in the film is when Adhi scolds Tara during a search party, Tara sobs a bit and says relationship isn't working and we are fighting ignoring the older couple. Tara immediately reconciles at that moment and they forget their differences. Mani Ratnam implies that younger generation may be casual about love or relationships at the outset, but when they get a chance to observe an older couple, they are able to adjust and adapt accordingly. Now this may or may not be true in real life, but in a cinematic sense this works and connects well. I feel sad that many people just dismiss OKK as just a live in relationship story. If that was the case, the climax would have been just the two drifting away forever towards their seperate ways.

   With the pre climax scenes,Maniratnam conveys a sense of melancholy and sadness we feel when we have to go away forever from a favourite place or a person we love. It is an Above Average film spiced up by humour, some interesting scenes and Rahmanâ€™s lovely BGM.
