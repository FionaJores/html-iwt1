   <h1>STORY</h1>
   <p>
      Geethanjali (/ɡiːθɑːndʒəli/) is a 1989 Indian Telugu-language romantic drama film written and directed by Mani Ratnam. The film stars Nagarjuna and Girija, with music composed by Ilaiyaraaja. The story revolves around two terminally ill individuals who fall in love, despite knowing they have limited time to live.

      Geethanjali was released on 12 May 1989. It became a commercial success, running for over 100 days in theatres and receiving praise for its direction, cinematography, music, and performances. The film won several awards, including the National Film Award for Best Popular Film and six state Nandi Awards including Best Feature Film.
      
      The film marked a turning point in Nagarjuna's career, making him a heartthrob among Telugu audiences and attracting a significant female following. Ratnam also gained considerable recognition in Andhra Pradesh due to this film. It was later unofficially remade in Hindi as Yaad Rakhegi Duniya (1992).
